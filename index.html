                        "One Fine Day" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. It first became a popular hit in the summer of 1963 for American girl group the Chiffons, who reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 1980, King covered it herself and charted at No. 12 on the Hot 100 with her version, becoming her last top 40 hit. The song has subsequently been covered by numerous artists over the years.

                        "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" is a 1967 song by American soul singer Aretha Franklin. The lyrics were written by Gerry Goffin from an idea by Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler, and the music was composed by Carole King. Written for Franklin, it reached number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and became one of her signature songs. Later King covered it herself on the album Tapestry.</p>

                      <p>
                        "The Loco-Motion" (or "Locomotion") is a pop song written by American songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King. It was originally written for R&B singer Dee Dee Sharp, but Sharp turned the song down.

                        The song is especially notable for making three appearances in the American top 3, each in a different decade: in 1962 by Little Eva in 1974 by Grand Funk Railroad and in 1988 by Kylie Minogue."                      </p>
